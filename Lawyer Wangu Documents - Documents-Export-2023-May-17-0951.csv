> Intermeddling with an estate could land you in Jail ,"<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>The definitive guide to Grants you need to administer an estate</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A loss in the family is a distressful and disorienting experience. It changes and destabilizes you and other people affected and it is only fair that you are given time to adjust to the new reality. Unfortunately, the world is not perfect and it keeps moving regardless of the tragedies you are facing, whatever obligations/responsibilities you had before, you are still going to have them after and if the deceased had any obligations the survivors would need to take them up and deal accordingly.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Some obligations are pressing such as medical/funeral expenses, school fees for children etcetera. and because you may have not anticipated a sudden absence they catch you by surprise. You begin looking at the deceased’s assets that can quickly realise cash and so you sell a motor vehicle or some personal effects they own. While your actions may be in good faith, before the law you have committed an offence by interfering/intermeddling with the estate of the deceased before administration and it could land you in jail.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>What is intermeddling?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There are many circumstances where you can be said to be intermeddling but the test is set out in Section 45(1) of the Law of Succession Act (LSA). It provides that no person is authorized to take possession, dispose or otherwise intermeddle with the free property of a deceased person for any purpose unless expressly authorized by the LSA or other written law or by a Grant of Representation. It is plain and simple that you have no business handling any free property (estate) of a deceased person unless you are permitted through a grant of representation or other enabling law or order. Section 45(2) provides that if you breach this provision you are guilty of a criminal offence - Intermeddling and are liable to a fine not exceeding Kshs.10,000 or to a term of imprisonment not exceeding one year or both. You would also be answerable to the rightful executor or administrator of the estate to the extent of the assets that you intermeddled with or appropriated. This article will take you through administration of an estate, what grants you require for different circumstances and where to get the Grants.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>What is Administration of an Estate</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Section 3 of the LSA defines an estate as the free property of a deceased person. It goes ahead to define free property as property which that person was legally competent freely to dispose during his lifetime, and in respect of which his interest has not been terminated by their death.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Administration is the process of managing the estate of a deceased person and includes collecting and safeguarding the assets, paying debts, liabilities and administration expenses and distributing estate to entitled beneficiaries.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>What is a Grant of Representation?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This is an order of a court appointing a petitioner/applicant as the personal representative of a deceased person. The personal representative is granted powers to administer the affairs and the estate of the deceased (as if the deceased were alive) in the name of the deceased. The personal representative is also responsible and answerable to the court and to the beneficiaries of the estate on how he/she has managed and accounted for the estate.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Grants of representation are issued depending on the circumstances and purposes as follows:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"">     i.  Grant of Probate - This is a grant of representation appointing an executor/executrix where the deceased had a valid will.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"">    ii.  Grant of Letters of Administration - This is a Grant of representation where the deceased has died without a will or a valid will. An entitled applicant is appointed as administrator of the estate.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"">   iii.  Limited Grants - Limited/temporary Grants of representation are issued under special circumstances mainly for the purpose of collecting and preserving the estate of the deceased before a full grant can be issued. These grants are provided for under rule 36-39 of the Probate and administration Rules.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Who can take out Grants of Representation?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Depending on the state of affairs of the deceased’s estate different people will be entitled to take out Grants. For example, where a person died with a will and had appointed executors, those executors would be entitled to take out Grant of Probate.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Section 66 of the LSA provides that where deceased dies without a will (intestacy) the court shall have final discretion as to the person(s) to whom Grant of Letters of Administration shall issue having regard to the best interest of all concerned but as a general guide the following order of preference is accepted:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"">   i.  Surviving spouse or spouses;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"">  ii.  Child or Children of the intestate;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;""> iii.  Parents of the intestate:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;""> iv.  Other beneficiaries entitled on intestacy, with priority according to their respective beneficial interests: brothers and sisters, half brothers and sisters and relatives who are in the nearest degree of consanguinity up to and including 6th Degree.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"">  v.  Public Trustees; and</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;""> vi.  Creditors.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Section 56 of the LSA provides that no Grants of Representation shall be issued to any person who is a Minor, of unsound mind or bankrupt. It further provides that no Grants shall be issued to more than four (4) people with respect to the same property or estate.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Where to apply for Grants of Representation</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In order to get a Grant one must apply to Court. One may apply to the High Court or the Magistrates’ Court.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Section 47 of the LSA provides that the High Court has jurisdiction to entertain any application and determine any dispute under the LSA and to make orders that they deem expedient.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Section 48 of the LSA as read together with the Magistrates’ Courts Act No.26 of 2015,    raises the jurisdiction of the Resident Magistrate to subject matter whose value does not exceed five million shillings. The Resident Magistrate can therefore preside over a probate application/petition where the value of the estate is below five million shillings and below provided it is not an application for revocation or annulment of a grant.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">When making an application personally, present the documents to the Principal Registry or the Residential Magistrate Registry and the Registrar will allocate the matter to the relevant Court OR Magistrate.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Types of Grants</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As we saw earlier there are different types of Grants that one can apply for depending on the state of affairs of the estate. If the deceased died with a will appointing executors the grants you apply for will be different from where the deceased died without a will.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The following are the different types of Grants and Forms used to apply for them:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">i.  Grant of Probate</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This is a Grant that is applied for where the deceased died with a will where they appointed an executor. That executor(s) is to apply for Grant of Probate.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Application is made in Petition Form 78 and Affidavit Form 3.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">ii.  Grant of Letters of Administration with Will Annexed</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This Grant is applied for when a person dies with a will, but without appointing and Executor. The spouse, children, parents, siblings etc. may apply for letters.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Application is made in Petition Form 79 and Affidavit Form 3.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">iii.  Grant of Probate of Proof of Oral Will</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This Grant is applied for where a person makes an oral will naming an executor and dies within 3 months of making it, or in the case of a member of the armed forces within the same period of active service.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Application is made in Petition – Form 44 and Affidavit form 3.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">iv.  Grant of Letters of Administration Intestate</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This Grant is applied for where a person dies without a will.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Application is made in Petition Form 80; Affidavit Form 5; Affidavit of Means Form 12 Affidavit of Justification of Proposed Sureties Form 11; and Guarantee of Personal Sureties Form 57.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">v.  Limited Grant (Grant ad Coligenda bona)</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Rule 36 of the Probate and Administration Rules 1980 provides that where because of special conditions or urgency it is not possible to make a full Grant of Representation on may apply to court for Grant ad colligenda bona to prevent estate from waste.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The purpose of this Grant is limited to only; collecting, receiving and preservation of an estate pending issuance of full Grant of Representation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Application is made in Petition Form 85 and Affidavit Form 19.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">vi.  Grant for Special Purposes</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">These Grants are made in special circumstances e.g. where there is urgency, where an administrator/executor dies before completing administration or where the estate is subject to litigation. They include:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"">● Administration ad Litem – This grant is used to institute or defend against suits to the estate only.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"">● Administration pendete lite – Where parties are disputing over the estate, the Court issues this grant to ensure the estate does not go to waste. No division or apportionment of the estate is done during this time. To apply for this grant you require Petition – Form 90 and Affidavit –Form 19.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"">● Grant of Letters of administration de bonis non administratitis or Probate at Rest – when the executor or administrator dies before completing administration another person may apply for this Grant for the purposes of completing administration. To apply for this grant you require Petition - Form 86 and Affidavit – Form 19.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"">● Special Limited Grant – this grant is applied for in special circumstances e.g. where one needs to pay school feed. To apply you require Petition –Form 85A and Affidavit – Form 19.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">vii.  Resealing of Grant of Probate or Letters of Administration</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Where a person dies abroad but had property in Kenya, Grant of Probate or Letters of administration are applied to in their country and then filed in the High Court in Kenya.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">To make an application to reseal a Grant of Probate or Letters of administration you need Petition- Form 81, Affidavit – Form 7 and a certified copy of the Grant issued by the foreign country.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Handling the estate of a deceased person is a delicate matter that should not be undertaken carelessly. Careless administration causes unnecessary turmoil within the family and results in prolonged court cases which ultimately undermine the estate.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The law is unequivocal, if you have not been issued with a grant of representation, you are a stranger before the law and if you deal or attempt to deal in anyway with the estate of a deceased person the repercussions are as dire as a jail term. We have laid out the appropriate proceedings to be followed when dealing with the estate of deceased person so you have lawful standing when dealing with an estate.</p>

> How to Create a Medical or Health Care Power of Attorney,"<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>MEDICAL OR HEALTH CARE POWER OF ATTORNEY</strong>
Background
A patient has to give informed consent before any medical procedures can be administered. Section 9 of the Health Act provides that a patient can authorise another person in writing to give consent on his or her behalf when they are unable to give informed consent. This is known as Medical Power of Attorney (Medical POA).</p>
<strong>What is a Medical POA</strong>
Medical POA is a legal document executed to take effect when a person who had duly appointed an Attorney is unable to give informed consent. This can arise in circumstances where:-

i. The Principal is under general anesthesia.

ii. The Principal suffers from an illness that incapacitates his or her ability to communicate e.g stroke.

iii. The Principal is in a comma or in an unconscious state.

iv. The Principal suffers from a disease that curtails his or her ability to make informed decisions e.g dementia.
<strong>Types of medical POA</strong>
a. General medical POA - this is where the Attorney is authorised to make all decisions regarding to the principal’s medical care.
b. Specific medical POA - this is where the Attorney is restricted to the nature of medical decisions that he or she can make regarding to the Principal’s medical care.
An attorney can make decisions regarding:-
i. The nature of medical care to be administered, i.e. surgery, medical treatments, medications, home healthcare, resuscitation instructions etc.
ii. The facilities where the medical care is to be administered.
iii. The doctors and other providers to administer medical care.
iv. Where the Principal will live e.g. nursing homes.
v. Caregivers for the Principal’s everyday needs.
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>How to create a Medical POA</strong>
a. Choose your trusted Attorney.
b. Speak to your intended agent beforehand and make sure they are willing to be your agent and to take your best interests at heart when making healthcare decisions for you.
c. Determine the healthcare decisions you want your agent to be able to make i.e general or specific medical POA.
d. Create a Medical Power of Attorney (Medical POA) here.
e. The medical POA should be executed and witnessed by an independent witness.
f. Share a copy of your medical POA with your Attorney.
g. Update your medical POA as your circumstances change - Whenever you amend the POA ensure it is duly executed and witnessed in order to validate the amendments.</p>",https://www.lawyerwangu.com/documents/how-to-create-a-medical-or-health-care-power-of-attorney/

> How to apply for a grant of Probate where there is a will,"Where a Testator (the person making the will) passes away, an Executor/Executrix (the person appointed to administer the estate) may apply for a grant of probate.

A Public Trustee may administer a deceased’s estate where a person with legitimate interest requests them to, or where no application for administration of the estate has been made within one month of the date of death.  Section 8 of the Public Trustee Act provides that the Public Trustee may administer an estate where the value of the deceased’s property does not exceed Kshs. 3,000,000 (Kenya shillings three million).

<strong>Where to apply for grant of representation</strong>

Section 47 and 48 of the Law of Succession Act provide that the High Court and Magistrate Court have jurisdiction to hear Succession matters. However, the Magistrate Court is limited to hearing matters where the value of the deceased’s property is less than 20 million shillings as per Section 7 of the Magistrates Court Act.

Rule 7(3) of the Probate and Administration Rules provides that the petition for administration may be filed in the principal registry or a High Court district registry.  Where the gross value of the estate does not exceed one hundred thousand shillings, the petition should be filed in a resident magistrate’s registry.

"> Domestic workers – The law, rights and Responsibilities","<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Matilda is a career woman working in a professional office in Westlands, Nairobi. For the last five years she had employed Rose as a house keeper, whose duty was among others house chores, taking care of the children and cooking. Rose’s day starts at 05.00 a.m. with washing cars and making breakfast for Baba Kazee before he leaves for work at 06.30 a.m. Thereafter, she prepares the children to go to school and thereafter attends to house chores. When children get back from school at 4 p.m., she washes them, makes them an afternoon snack, cooks dinner and serves them by 7.00 p.m. She thereafter cleans up and eventually retires to sleep at about 09.00 p.m.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Rose earns a monthly salary of Kshs. 10,000. She lives in the homestead and eats what she cooks for the rest of the family. Rose goes to church early on Sunday mornings and doesn’t come back until late in the afternoon. Whenever Rose is unwell Matilda ensured that she foots the bills. Rose is not under any medical scheme including NHIF. She agreed with Matilda that she does not want to pay NSSF or any other deductions from her salary. The terms of employment are all verbal and it has worked out well for both of them.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Rose has been a fantastic employee until the last three months when Matilda noticed that Rose’s attitude had drastically changed. She got very moody, insolent and harsh to the children. She had also become lazy. She slept till late in the morning and on a few occasions, Baba Kazee went to work without breakfast and the house stayed unkept. Matilda had on several occasions politely discussed Rose’s change in behaviour with her without any improvement. She was very relieved that Rose agreed to leave employment without any drama. Matilda paid Rose her salary and she left.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Last week, Matilda received a letter from Kenya Union of Domestic Hotels Educational Institutions Hospitals &amp; Allied Workers (KUDHEIHA). Rose’s claims among others were:</p>

<ol style=""text-align: justify;"">
 	<li>She was not given or paid for notice before termination.</li>
 	<li>Salary underpayment.</li>
 	<li>She had not taken leave for the last five years.</li>
 	<li>She was not paid overtime. She was working from 5.00 a.m. to 9.00 p.m.</li>
 	<li>Service pay for 5 years.</li>
 	<li>Damages for unfair termination.</li>
 	<li>Unremitted NSSF and NHIF dues.</li>
</ol>
<ul style=""text-align: justify;""></ul>
<ol start=""5"" style=""text-align: justify;""></ol>
<ul style=""text-align: justify;""></ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Who is a domestic worker?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">According to <em>Order 2</em> of <em>Regulation of Wages (Domestic Servants Wages Council Establishment) Order</em>, a domestic servant refers to any person employed wholly in any private household in any of the following capacities, namely cook, house servant (including bedroom and kitchen servant), waiter, butler, children’s nurse, chauffeur, bar attendant, groom, gardener, or watchman. Rose was therefore a domestic worker in Matilda’s household.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Rights of an employee</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">According to <em>Section 2</em> of both the <em>Employment Act</em> and <em>Labour Relations Act</em>, an employee is a person employed for wages or a salary and includes an apprentice and indentured learner. Domestic workers are also employees within the meaning of the law.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">According to, <em>Article 41 (2) </em>of the <em>Constitution of Kenya (CoK)</em> an employee is entitled to:</p>

<ol style=""text-align: justify;"">
 	<li>Fair remuneration;</li>
 	<li>To reasonable working conditions; and</li>
 	<li>To form, join or participate in the activities and programs of a trade union.</li>
</ol>
<ul style=""text-align: justify;""></ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The<em> Employment Act </em>and other laws,<em> expound</em> on the above constitutional preserves for an employee as follows:</p>
<strong>     i) Basic minimum conditions of employment</strong>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Under <em>Section 26</em> of the <em>Employment Act</em>, an employee is entitled to basic minimum terms and conditions of employment including fair remuneration, humane working conditions and basic terms regulated by any collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The <em>Regulation of Wages (General) (Amendment) Order </em>of 2018, provides for the minimum remuneration of domestic workers based on location. Domestic workers in the cities of <strong>Nairobi, Kisumu and Mombasa</strong> ought to be paid a minimum of <strong>Kshs. 13,572.90 </strong>per month. Those in former municipalities or town councils of <strong>Mavoko, Ruiru and Limuru</strong> ought to be paid a minimum of <strong>Kshs. 12, 522.70</strong>, while those in all other areas ought to be paid a minimum of <strong>Kshs. 7,240.95</strong> per month excluding house allowance. (Valid as at September 2020)</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Employers, be aware that any agreement to pay a domestic worker below the minimum prescribed wage is not protected by the law. The Courts have been categorical that the minimum wage must be adhered to. In the case of <em>Robai Musinzi v Sadfar Mohamed Khan </em>(2012), the Court ruled that domestic workers are entitled to the minimum wage provided in the <em>Regulation of Wages Order</em>.</p>
<strong>     ii) Right to leave</strong>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Under <em>Section 27 to 30</em> of the <em>Employment Act</em>, Employees are entitled to:</p>

<ol style=""text-align: justify;"">
 	<li>One rest day in every seven day period of service;</li>
 	<li>At least twenty-one working days of annual leave with full pay;</li>
 	<li>Three months maternity leave or two weeks paternity leave with full pay; and</li>
 	<li>Sick leave of not less than seven days on full pay and seven days on half pay.</li>
</ol>
<strong>     iii) Working hours </strong>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The prescribed maximum working hours for an employee is fifty-two hours every week. Working hours in excess of the fifty-two hours is considered overtime. <em>Order 6 </em>of the<em> Regulations of Wages (General) Order, </em>overtime is payable in addition to the salary at the rate of <sup>1</sup>/<sub>225</sub><sup>th</sup> of the monthly salary per hour.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Working time evaluation for domestic workers is difficult given the nature of their work. Their working hours depend on the Employers schedule. There is also no clear measure of the actual time they work and the intermittent breaks they take.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em>Section 27</em> of the <em>Employment Act,</em> gives leeway to the Employer to regulate the working hours in accordance with the law. This means that parties can agree how working hours are managed and whether there is payment of overtime for as long it is within the law. For example, the Employer and the Employee can agree on a salary that is all inclusive of overtime or other contributions (for as long as the salary is above the prescribed minimum).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In absence of an employment agreement the onus of proof of any term of employment is on the Employer as the law requires that the Employer must give an employment agreement to any person in employment for more than three months.</p>
<strong>     iv) Medical attention</strong>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Under <em>Section 34</em> of <em>the Employment Act</em>, the Employer is required to provide sufficient medication to an employee during illness. Medication is unpredictable and sometimes can be very expensive. This requirement is satisfied if the Employee is under NHIF cover or other medical insurance scheme.</p>
<strong>     v) Right to housing </strong>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em>Section 31 </em>of the<em> Employment Act,</em> requires that an Employer should provide reasonable housing or alternatively pay house allowance. <em>Section 31 (2),</em> provides that housing allowance shall not apply if the contract of service provides for a consolidated pay that is inclusive of house allowance.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Where housing is not provided or where there is no employment contract, the Courts interpretation has been that the salary provided is basic salary and house allowance at the rate of 15% of basic pay should be paid in addition. In the case <em>Caroline Wanjiru Luzze v Nestle Equatorial African Region Limited</em>, (2016), the Court ruled that housing allowance should be added to the basic pay if it is not part of a consolidated salary or not being provided by the employer.</p>
<strong>     vi) Provision of water and food</strong>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">An employer is required to provide water to the employees at the place of employment. Provision of drinking water suffices unless the Employer is providing accommodation in which case the Employer shall provide water within a reasonable distance of the accommodation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Provision of food is <strong>not</strong> a mandatory requirement unless it is an agreed term of contract.</p>
<strong>     vii) Termination notice </strong>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em>Section 35</em> of the <em>Employment Act,</em> provides that an Employee on a monthly salary should be given termination notice of at least 28 days. Alternatively, the Employer is required to pay salary in lieu of notice. Similarly, when the Employee is resigning they are required to give equivalent notice.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>     viii)  </strong><strong>NSSF contributions.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em>Section 20</em> of <em>National Social Security Fund </em>(<em>NSSF) Act</em>, provides that the Employer is required to pay the prescribed amount and contribute an equivalent amount to the Fund. It is the Employers obligation to remit both the Employers and Employees contributions to the fund.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Responsibilities of an Employee </strong></p>

<ol style=""text-align: justify;"">
 	<li>To obey the terms and conditions under the employment contract;</li>
 	<li>Not to absent from duty without reasonable cause;</li>
 	<li>To perform their duties diligently and responsibly;</li>
 	<li>Not to use any intoxicants or drugs during working hours;</li>
 	<li>Not to use abusive language on the employer or a person in authority;</li>
 	<li>To obey lawful instruction by the employer; and</li>
 	<li>Not to commit any offences against the employer.</li>
</ol>
<ul style=""text-align: justify;""></ul>
<ol style=""text-align: justify;""></ol>
<ul style=""text-align: justify;""></ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>A review of the case scenario</strong></p>

<ol style=""text-align: justify;"">
 	<li>Was Matilda obliged to respond to the claim by the KUDHEIHA? - The Employer is obliged to respond and report to the Labour officer if summoned.</li>
 	<li>Was Rose entitled to termination notice or payment in lieu? - Yes. Unless Rose resigned on her own volition (in writing).</li>
 	<li>Was Matilda underpaying Rose? – Yes. The minimum prescribed for Nairobi is Kshs. 13,572.90. Rose is entitled to the underpayment for each year as prescribed in the <em>Regulation of Wages (General) (Amendment) Order </em>for each year<em>.</em></li>
 	<li>How many days leave is Rose entitled to? – 21 days for every completed year of service and <em>pro rata</em> 1.75 days for every month.</li>
 	<li>Is Rose entitled to overtime? – Yes for 7hrs and 20 minutes every day. She was required to work for only 8.6 hours every day.</li>
 	<li>Is Rose entitled to service pay? – Yes as per <em>Section 35(6) </em>of the<em> Employment Act,</em> at the rate of 15 days for each completed year of service (unless she was on NSSF or any other pension scheme).</li>
 	<li>Is Rose entitled to the unremitted NSSF and NHIF dues? – No. However, nothing prohibits NSSF and NHIF to claim the remittances being a statutory obligation of the Employer.</li>
 	<li>Rose and Matilda agreed that Roses salary should not have NSSF and NHIF or other deductions. Was this valid agreement? – No. Parties are prohibited to contract for an illegal purpose. NSSF and NHIF can at any time call for the deductions from Matilda.</li>
 	<li>Is Rose entitled to damages for unfair termination? – Only if Rose can prove that there was an invalid reason for termination or that the procedure for termination was not followed.</li>
</ol>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Domestic workers are a special category of employees and many of them are semi- literate. Kenyan jurisprudence through the Employment and Labour Relations Court has adopted a very lenient approach to the employee given their educational exposure and greater responsibility is placed upon the Employers. The burden of proof of the terms of engagement rests with the Employer and the courts approach has been unless under written contract, the court will not make an unfavourable interpretation of any term of contract against the Employee. The Court in the case of <em>Stella Mukoko Amutabi v Saijal Shikotra</em> (2014), ruled that an Employer has the duty to inform the employee whenever there is a change in the terms of the contract preferably in writing, and in a language the Employee understands.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">To avoid unnecessary and complicated disputes with your domestic workers it is easier and safer to draw up an employment agreement with clear terms and conditions of engagement.</p>

> Are you an Employee or an Independent Contractor,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">You have a gardener who tends to your garden from Monday to Saturday. You pay them a monthly salary. However, your gardener is only in your house from 6 a.m. to 9.00 a.m., and then he leaves for work elsewhere. Is he your Employee, or is he an independent contractor.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There has been an increase in the flexibility of employment relationships, with many adopting independent contractor agreements as opposed to Employees. The law distinguishes Employees from independent contractors. An Employer-Employee relationship creates an employment contract known as a contract of service while a client contractor relationship creates an independent contractor agreement known as a contract for services. What distinguishes the two contracts?</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>What is a Contract of Service</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Section 2 of the Employment Act defines a contract of service as an agreement, whether oral or in writing, to employ or to serve as an Employee for a period of time. It includes internships. Therefore, a contract of service is an agreement between an Employer and an Employee containing the terms of engagement.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Section 9 of the Act provides that a contract for service for three months or more must be in writing. This contract must state particulars of employment and must be given within two months of employment.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The case of Ready Mixed Concrete (South East) Ltd v Minister of Pensions and National Insurance (1968) set out the conditions required to establish a contract of service. It stated that a contract of service will be established where:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">(i)           The servant agrees to provide his own work and skill by providing a service for their master, in consideration of a wage or other remuneration.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">(ii)          The servant agrees that in the performance of that service they will be subject to the master’s control. Control includes the power of deciding the thing to be done, the way in which it shall be done, the means to be employed in doing it, the time, and the place where it shall be done.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">(iii)         The contract of service complies with the terms of an employment agreement. This entails complying with the statutory requirements in the Employment Act including minimum wage, provision for leave and payment of income tax.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>What does a contract of service entail?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">i.        the Employees details;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">ii.        the Employers details;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">iii.        the job description;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">iv.        commencement date of the employment;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">v.        the duration of the contract;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">vi.        the place of work;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">vii.        the hours of work;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">viii.        the remuneration and details of any other benefits;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">ix.        the intervals at which remuneration is paid; and</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">x.        any other prescribed matter.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Who is an Employer?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">An Employer is defined in the Act as any person, or body who has entered into a contract of service to employ any individual or company. According to the Black’s Law dictionary, an Employer is one who controls a worker under a contract and pays the worker a salary or a wage. A salary is defined as an agreed compensation for services paid at regular intervals, normally monthly. A wage on the other hand is payment for labour or services usually based on time worked or quantity produced. It includes every form of remuneration for personal services.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Income Tax Act defines an Employer as any resident person responsible for the payment of, or on account of, emoluments to an Employee.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Therefore, an Employer is one who enters into a contract with an individual or company, is in control of the worker, pays them a salary and then remits their taxes to the Kenya Revenue Authority.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Who is an Employee?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Section 2 of the Act defines an Employee as a person employed for wages or a salary and includes an intern. According to the Black’s law dictionary, an Employee is one who works in the service of another person, under the Employer’s control.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Rights of an Employee</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Rule 7 of the Employment General Rules states that an Employer shall issue a statement stipulating the rights of an Employee. This statement shall be placed in a conspicuous place, which is accessible to all Employees. The statement should include the following rights. The right:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">i.        To be issued with a letter of appointment for an Employee engaged on a continuous service for more than three months. The letter of employment should include the employment details;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">ii.        To one rest day in every period of seven days;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">iii.        To at least twenty-one working days leave during a period of twelve months continuous service;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">iv.        To three months maternity leave with full pay for female Employees;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">v.        To sick leave of at least seven days with full pay and seven days at half pay;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">vi.        To housing allowance or provision of a house or a wage which is inclusive of house allowance;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">vii.        To compensation by the Government in the event of insolvency of the Employer;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">viii.        To be paid wages at intervals agreed, subject to deductions authorized by law;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">ix.        To work for a maximum of fifty-two hours of work spread over six days of the week ,sixty hours of work per week for a person employed on night work, and less than six hours a day for a person under the age of sixteen years;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">x.        To be paid wages at the end of each day where the Employee is a casual Employee;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">xi.        To be issued with an itemized pay statement where an Employee is on a continuous contract for more than six months;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">xii.        To termination notice of 28 days, however, where the contract is for payment of daily wages, either party may terminate at the close of any day without notice;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">xiii.        To at least fifteen days pay for each completed year of service where the Employee is terminated on account of redundancy;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">xiv.        To a disciplinary hearing for misconduct where the Employee has had a continuous contract with an Employer for more than thirteen months; and</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">xv.        To a certificate of service upon termination of the contract.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">https://www.lawyerwangu.com/employment/employment-agreements/certificate-of-service/</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Case analysis</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">i)     The case of Everret Aviation Limited vs the Kenya Revenue Authority (2013) determined whether a contract of service or a contract for services existed. The facts of the case are that Everret sub-contracted pilots to undertake special tasks. They had two sets of pilots, that is resident freelance pilots and non-resident freelance pilots who both did the same work. KRA audited the Companies accounts as it considered the payments made to the pilots as salaries that were subject to PAYE. KRA held that PAYE was payable for the resident pilots while withholding tax was payable for the non-resident pilots and demanded Kshs. 6,699,425 being PAYE for the years 2000-2002. Everret contested KRA’s finding stating that the pilots were not Employees as:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">a.            the pilots were not integrated into the appellants business;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">b.            the pilots procured their pilot licences independently;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">c.            they were employed for a few hours or weeks;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">d.            they were not paid a monthly wage; and</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">e.            the Employer had no control over the pilots.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The High Court held that Everret was in control of the pilots as it bore the risk of profit, paid the pilots, released them, and identified their tasks. The court argued that the pilots were being paid directly and not to a 3rd party and therefore, it was a contract of services, making the Employer Liable to pay PAYE for both the resident and non-resident pilots. It held that when distinguishing a contract of service from a contract for services, the traditional tests of control of the work by the Employer and its integration into the Employer's core business are no longer conclusive. The fundamental behaviour of the parties such as the form of documentation evidencing the relationship and the mode of payment is critical.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In my opinion, this conclusion is contradictory as the court based its judgement on the level of control the Employer exercised over the pilot, and then went on to say that the level of control is no longer a conclusive measure. They also stated that the courts should look at the mode of payment where monthly salaries and wages are paid to Employees and not independent Contractors. The pilots were not paid a monthly salary and the courts still went ahead and concluded that the pilots were Employees and not independent Contractors.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">ii)    In the case of Paul Ochieng’ Agola v Gateway Marine Services Limited [2018] EKLR, the Claimant averred that he was an Employee of the respondent as a Machine Operator, in the year 2012 where he earned a monthly salary of Kshs. 24,000.  The Respondent summarily dismissed him, on 19th March 2016.  He sued the Employer, stating that his dismissal was unfair. The terms of employment were that he was employed as a Casual Employee, who was engaged on and off, depending on availability of work, between 2012 to 2015 and was paid a daily wage. The Respondent however held he was an independent contractor. The Claimant adduced evidence including a copy of leave application supporting the view that he enjoyed an employment benefit of paid annual leave.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Court held that there was no independent contract between the Parties, as there was no oral or documentary proof of such a contract. It held that the Claimant was a casual worker, who was paid a monthly wage and enjoyed the benefits of an Employee, and therefore, he was unfairly dismissed. The court stated that Independent Contractors do not enjoy employment benefits like annual leave and neither are they paid wages.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In this case, the court looked at the terms of engagement of the parties such as the mode of payment and the employment benefits to determine whether the Claimant was an Employee. A contractor would not enjoy leave days and therefore it was rational to conclude that the Claimant was indeed an Employee and not an independent Contractor as insinuated by the Employer.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>What is a Contract for Services</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This is an agreement between two parties, where one party provides a service to the other in consideration for payment. This agreement appoints a self-employed person (Independent contractor) such as a consultant to carry out services for another party.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Who is an independent contractor?</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Black’s Law dictionary defines an Independent Contractor as one who is entrusted to undertake a specific project, but who is left free to do the assigned work and choose the method for accomplishing it. The independent contractor is liable for their actions unlike an Employee where the Employer is vicariously liable for their actions.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">An Independent Contractor performs work for another Person, according to the Independent Contractor’s own processes and methods. They carry out business on their own account. They are not under the control of the client. They are bound by the terms of the contract and do not get statutory benefits unlike Employees. A contract for services agreement does not create an Employer-Employee relationship.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Case analysis</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">i)     In the case of Fredrick Byakika v Mutiso Menezes International Unlimited (2016), the Claimant sought payment for unfair dismissal. The facts of the case are that he was employed as a resident engineer for a project in Kampala for a period of 12 months. The terms of the contract were that the claimant would be paid a monthly gross remuneration of $5,260.00 upon issuance of an invoice and subject to withholding tax at 5%. One month into the contract, he fell ill and could not perform his duties. The respondent then terminated the contract. The Claimant was paid Kshs. 240,000.00 as terminal dues. The Claimant then sued the Employer, stating that the summary dismissal was wrongful. The Claimant argued that he was the Respondents Employee as he was the project representative meaning he was under the control of the respondent. He also stated that he had a schedule where he was required to follow and therefore argued that he was integrated within the work of the respondent. The court however held that the Claimant was appointed as a Consultant and was required to be part of the Project Consultancy Team as a Resident Engineer for the project. He was therefore not entitled to the Employee benefits he was seeking.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Court described an Independent Contractor as a registered taxpayer who will work their own hours, run their own business, is free to carry out work for more than one Employer at the same time, invoices the Employer each month, and is not subject to employment terms such as deduction of PAYE, annual leave, and sick leave. It also held that the use of the terms such as salary, employment terms and conditions, summary dismissal do not, by themselves, confer an employment relationship. The Courts would have to look into factors such as the intention of the parties, to determine whether they give rise to an employment contract or that of an independent contractor.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Therefore, even though the Claimant was paid a monthly salary, the salary was subject to withholding tax and not PAYE. Where the payment is subject to withholding tax, it means that there is no Employer-Employee relationship but an independent contractor relationship. In an Employer-Employee relationship, the Employer will pay the Employee’s tax as PAYE to KRA.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">ii)    In Maurice Oduor Okech v. The Chequered Flag Limited [2011] EKLR, the court held that the Claimant was an independent contractor and not an Employee. The facts of the case are that the Claimant was by oral agreement, employed by the Respondent as a cushion maker on 7th August 1998. He was paid between Kshs. 25,000-30,000 at the end of each completed assignment. His contract was terminated in October 2010. He brought a claim seeking remedies for unfair termination.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The respondent held that the Claimant was an independent Contractor, and not an Employee, and therefore unable to claim remedies as an Employee. The Claimant stated that he was an Employee as he was integrated into the business as he was working in the respondent’s office. He then produced an employment card and a photo in the company uniform to prove that he was an Employee. According to the respondent, he issued the Claimant with an Employee card, which did not have an Employee number, in order to avoid harassment by the Police while going home at night. He also claimed that he had allowed the Claimant to work from his office for some time but later asked him to leave after he brought unauthorised people to the office on various occasions. On 13th of October 2013, the Respondent sent the Claimant Kshs. 11,500 to buy material for a customer but failed to deliver. The respondent then terminated the contract.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The court held that the documentation produced i.e. the local purchase orders and the payment vouchers were documents used in contracts for services. It also held that the mode of payment i.e. payment after completion of a job and issuing of an invoice to the respondent to pay, are modes of payment used in contracts for services. Therefore, the Claimant was not an Employee of the Respondent but an independent contractor under a contract for services.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Therefore, an independent contractor could be integrated into the Employers business, including adhering to the dress code, reporting time and having an employment card, but still be an independent contractor. In this case, it was clear that the Claimant was contracted for a specific service and was paid after issuing an invoice after delivery of the service. The courts will therefore look beyond the traditional test of integration into the Employers business, and will look into the engagement of the parties in order to determine whether it is a contract of service or for services.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Employment Act will bind an Employer-Employee relationship. However, it does not bind an independent contractor agreement.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Employers are very quick to state that the Employee is an independent Contractor and not an Employee when an issue arises, in order to escape from the responsibilities required in an Employer-Employee relationship. It is prudent for Employers to have contracts with their Employees in order to avoid blurring the line and having an ambiguous contract that does not have clear terms. The illustration given above of the gardener could create either contract. Where the terms of engagement are not clear, the gardener could be considered a part time domestic worker who has the rights of an Employee. However, if the Employer draws up a contract and stipulates that the gardener be contracted as an independent Contractor for the provision of gardening services, then the gardener will be an independent Contractor. It is advisable for Employers and Employees, and Clients and independent Contractors to reduce their relationship in writing to avoid ambiguity.</p>
